# 🔥 DataForge: Multi-Role, Multi-Domain Data Portfolio by Sai Satwik

**DataForge** is a solo-built, modular portfolio designed to showcase real-world data capabilities across multiple roles—**Data Analyst**, **Data Engineer**, **Data Scientist**, and **Data Strategist**—and across high-impact domains like **Healthcare**, **Finance**, **Retail**, and **Public Services**.

This project is built entirely from scratch to demonstrate technical depth, analytical thinking, and strategic storytelling. Each module is self-contained and reflects a core skill set aligned with industry expectations.
